Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers


### Overview
This full stack app allows users to answer questions about themselves and upload an image to find new friends who are similar based on the questionaire inputs. Each user is stored through express to be potentially matched with other users.

### Instructions

Users will need to do an "npm install" in the terminal before using this application. Following the npm install, the user will need to "node server.js" in terminal to create the local server before going to the localhost port in the browser, in this case, port 3000.
